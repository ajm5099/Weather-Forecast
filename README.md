## Basic Overview of Project
The weather dashboard is a place users can go to view the current weather, and 5 day extended forecast for any city they search for. The program will also save cities the user searched for in a list, for quick recall. The project makes extensive use of the open weather API for its data source, and uses AJAX requests to pull in up to date weather data.


## User Stories
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
